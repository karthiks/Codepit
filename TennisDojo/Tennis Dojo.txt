Completion Steps
================

START SIMPLE! What is the smallest/easiest thing to move this forward?
For me, I think it will be to create the "Return Current Game Score". Having this will make checking the progress of "Games" easier.

First Test, "Create a Game Score with 0 Points".
	- Simply Create Some Public Fields in GameScore.
Second Tests: "Player 1 Scores Point, Points Should be 1-0".
	- Note We Are Testing 2x Things (1 and Nil) == 2 Tests
	- To Pass, Simply Increment the Player1Score.
	- I Set to "private set" Here - No Way to "Test".
	- Note We Have Code Dupe (New GameScore, Player1Scores).
	- I Created a Factory Method and Helper Extensions.
Additional Basic Tests (Everything Up to "Advantage").
	- Player 2 Scores 1 Points (0-1).
	- Player 1 Scores 1, Player 2 Scores (1-1).
	- Player 1 Scores 2, Player 2 Scores 2 (2-2).	
	- Here I Updated Player 2 to Match Player 1 Score Property.
	- These Tests Pass Easily Once "Player2Scored" Added.
	- No Fail? We Can Prove the Tests Are "Good" by Altering Score.
Basic "Advantage" Tests
	- Both Players Do Not Have Advantage on Ctor
		- Simplest Thing? Return False!
	- Player 1 Scores 3x, Player 2 Zero = Player1HasAdvantage.
		- Simplest Thing? Return Player1Score == 3.
	- Player 2 Scores 3x, Player 1 Zero = Player2HasAdvantage.
		- Simplest Thing? Return Player2Score == 3.
Basic "Deuce" Tests
	- IsDeuce == False on Ctor.
		- Simply Return False.
	- Player 1 Scores 3, Player 2 Scores 3 == IsDeuce
		- Return Player1Score == 3 && Player2Score == 3
	- Player 1 Does Not Have Advantage in Deuce
		- Added Method "ScoreHasAdvantage"
		- Reduce Code Dupe - New Extension Method - ToDeuce
	- Player 2 Does Not Have Advantage in Deuce
		- Update Getter to Use "ScoreHasAdvantage"
Final Deuce Tests
	- From Duece, Player 1 Scores
		- New Score should be 3-2.
		- Player 1 Has Advantage
	- From Duece, Player 2 Scores
		- New Score should be 2-3.
		- Player 2 Has Advantage
	- Both Easily Solved by Checking "IsDeuce".
